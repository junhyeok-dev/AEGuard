# AEGuard
## Motivation

As computer vision technology and image-based machine learning have developed and widespread, massive security systems based on image data are designed and deployed. At the same time, adversarial attack, the security attack that makes the image-based machine learning model misjudge by modulating input image, also has developed and widespread.

AEGuard is an adversarial sample detection model based on edge noise features, which commonly appears in adversarial samples.
